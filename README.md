# Unsupervised Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of unsupervised customer segmentation techniques based on the provided dataset. Using various clustering algorithms, the goal is to identify distinct customer profiles that can enhance marketing strategies and improve service offerings.

## Key Findings

1. **Data Preprocessing**: A thorough data cleaning process was applied to remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis. Missing values were handled appropriately, and categorical variables were encoded for clustering.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics and visualizations were conducted to understand the distribution of different features and their relationships.
   
3. **Clustering Algorithms**: Multiple clustering algorithms were tested, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. Each method's effectiveness was evaluated using metrics like Silhouette Score and Elbow Method.
   
4. **Optimal Number of Clusters**: The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method, and the resulting clusters were evaluated. The ideal configurations clearly segmented the customers into actionable groups.
   
5. **Interpretation of Clusters**: Detailed analysis and profiling of each customer segment highlighted key characteristics, such as purchasing behavior, demographic information, and preferences.
   
6. **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations for targeted marketing strategies based on the identified customer segments were formulated to maximize engagement and conversion rates.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis, clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks in your local environment. Ensure all required libraries are installed as per the `requirements.txt` file.

## Conclusion
The findings from this analysis provide valuable insights into customer behavior. By implementing the recommendations derived from the segmentation results, businesses can better tailor their offerings to meet customer needs, enhancing overall satisfaction and loyalty.
