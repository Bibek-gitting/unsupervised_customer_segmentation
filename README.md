# Unsupervised Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This repository presents an unsupervised methodology for customer segmentation utilizing various clustering algorithms to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, categorical encodings, and normalization.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implement K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.
- **Visualizations:** Generate informative plots to analyze and interpret clusters.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate clustering results using silhouette scores and other metrics.

## Methodology
The project leverages historical data to segment customers into distinct groups using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Clustering Algorithms
- **K-means:** Partitions data into k distinct clusters based on distance to the centroid.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters using agglomerative methods.
- **DBSCAN:** Groups together points that are closely packed and marks points lying alone in low-density regions as outliers.

## Visualizations
Visual representations will include:
- Scatter plots of clusters
- Dendrograms for hierarchical clustering
- Elbow method results for optimal k in K-means

## Metrics
We will evaluate the clustering effectiveness using:
- Silhouette Score
- Davies–Bouldin Index
